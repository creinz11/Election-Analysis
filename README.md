# Election-Analysis

## Summary
The Purpose of this analysis was to conduct a congressional election audit for the state of Colorado. As a part of this analysis, we were asked to tabulate and review the candidates result (total votes and percentage of the vote recieved) and project a winner. In additional to a candidate level analysis, we provided a breakdown of votes by county (Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson) and determine the county with the greatest voter turnout. We were able to conduct this analysis of the election results (provided in a csv format) using Python and VS code.

## Resources:

## Applicability to Future Elections
While this analysis was conducted specifically for this congressional election, the board can continue to use this script for future elections. With relatively little alterations, the board could use this for other types of election. The most notable change would be importing a new CSV, and appending the python scripts to point to the new source material. In future elections, assuming a wider variety of data is compiled in the csv, the board could create new lists and dictionaries to conduct analysis on voter demographics relative to outcome and candidate.
